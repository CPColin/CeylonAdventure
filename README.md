# CeylonAdventure
Practicing programming in Ceylon by porting games from "[Creating Adventure Games on Your Computer](http://www.atariarchives.org/adventure/index.php)" by Tim Hartnell from BASIC. Gaining a feel for what it means to be "ceylonic."

## Werewolves and Wanderer
The first game in the book, "Werewolves and Wanderer" is pretty straightforward. In the book, it gets an "Improved Version" that may turn into an exercise in inheritance. Some bugs have been fixed. (You couldn't actually run from monsters in the BASIC version.)
