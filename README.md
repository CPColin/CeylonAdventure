# CeylonAdventure
Practicing programming in Ceylon by porting games from "[Creating Adventure Games on Your Computer](http://www.atariarchives.org/adventure/index.php)" by Tim Hartnell from BASIC. Gaining a feel for what it means to be "ceylonic." (Note that the code contains way too many uses of the `variable` annotation, which is decidedly *not* ceylonic. The Ceylarquest code builds off the lessons learned here.)

## Werewolves and Wanderer
The first game in the book, "Werewolves and Wanderer" is pretty straightforward. In the book, it gets an "Improved Version" that may turn into an exercise in inheritance. Some bugs have been fixed. (You couldn't actually run from monsters in the BASIC version.)

## Aftermath of the Asimovian Disaster
The second game in the book, not counting the "Improved Version" of the first game, takes the structure of the first game and demonstrates how it could be adapted into a new experience. The concept of probabilistic room descriptions, from the "Improved Version" of "Werewolves and Wanderer," makes it into this game, but most of the code is identical to the original version.
